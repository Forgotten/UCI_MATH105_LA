    "Mueller's method is another root-finding method. It uses 3 points to approximate your function locally with a parabola, and then computes the intersection of the parabola with $y=0$ to update one of your points. The main advantage of Mueller's method with respect to Newton's method and its variant, is that it can compute complex roots."
