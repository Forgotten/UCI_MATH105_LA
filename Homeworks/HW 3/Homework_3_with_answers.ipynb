    "### Question 1:  Mueller's Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Mueller's method is another root-finding method. It uses 3 points to approximate your function locally with a parabola, and then computes the intersection of the parabola with $y=0$ to update one of your points. The main advantage of Mueller's method with respect to Newton's method and its variant, is that it can compute complex roots."

    "Your function will raise an error if the convergence is not reached in the specified number of iterations.\n",
