    "###Question 1: Fixed Point Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The fixed point method is an iterative algorihtm usually used to solve algebraic equations. In adition, it is a powerful theoretical tool to find (and show existence and uniqueness) solutions to ODE's (normally called Picard-Lindelof Theorem, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picard–Lindelöf_theorem)\n",
    "\n",
    "1.a You will implement the fixed point method, for an input function $f$, an initial guess $p0$, a tolerance $\\epsilon$, and a maximum number of iterations $Nmax$. Your function will have an optional paremeter named $history$, which by default will be false. \n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the function will output the final guess, $p$, with a tolerance $\\epsilon$. In this case we follow Alg. 2.2 in your textbook. The tolerance is achieved when $|p_{n+1} - p_n | < \\epsilon$. \n",
    "\n",
    "If history is true, then the output will be a vector with all the intermediary values of the fixed point iteration. The length of the vector will be the number of iterations needed to converge (up to a tolerance $\\epsilon$). (you can use the push! function in Julia, to initialize an empty vector you can use a = Float[]).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the tolerance is not achieved in the Nmax iterations you will raise an error, with a descriptive message, using the function error ."
