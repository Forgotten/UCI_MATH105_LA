The answer is that operation with bigger numbers tend to be more expensive. If you don't need too much precision, you would want to use single or half. One example can be found in graphics cards, that are optimized for single precision computations, in order to save space to and speedup the rendering; your eye won't see a 0.001% variation in the color of a pixel.\n",
